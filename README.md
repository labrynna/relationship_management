# 🧠 Relationship Management Automation

Automatically maintain meaningful relationships by staying in touch with friends, family, colleagues, and professional contacts—without letting anyone fall through the cracks.

## 💡 What This Project Does

This Python script reads contact details from an Excel database and creates personalized reminders for:

- Staying in touch at custom intervals (e.g., monthly, quarterly)
- Remembering birthdays and other special dates
- Sending messages via Microsoft To Do through Zapier-triggered emails

I built this to solve a personal challenge: keeping in touch consistently with the people who matter most, without relying on memory.

## ✅ Results

- I never forget birthdays or important dates.
- I keep in touch with my full network on a regular basis.
- Drafting messages is partly automated (soon to be fully AI-powered).
- My relationships have improved in quality—and I save time every week.
